The Second project of the "Data Structures" course \
In this project, first I stepped through building up Data Structures such as Linked List, Queue and Stack. Then by implementing Expression tree and it algorithms, I made a platform in which by entering commands, the related actions will be taken. \
These commands are all predefined by certain rules.

1) #define __variable name or function name__ = __arithmetic expression__ \
This can be used to define both variables and functions. Example:

2) #print __arithmetic expression__ or __variable name__
This can be used to print both arithmetic expressions and variables and functions. Example:
